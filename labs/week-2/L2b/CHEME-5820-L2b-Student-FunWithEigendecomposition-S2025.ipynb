    "# Lab 2b: Eigendecomposition of Stoichiometric Matrices\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore the eigendecomposition of a standard matrix in chemical systems: the stoichiometric matrix $\\mathbf{S}$. The stoichiometric matrix is the digital representation of a chemical reaction system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a stoichiometric matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a set of chemical (or biochemical) reactions $\\mathcal{R}$ involving the chemical species (metabolite) set $\\mathcal{M}$. Then, the stoichiometric matrix is a $\\mathbf{S}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{M}|\\times|\\mathcal{R}|}$ matrix that holds the stoichiometric coefficients $\\sigma_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{S}$ such that:\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{ij}>0$: Chemical species (metabolite) $i$ is _produced_ by reaction $j$. Species $i$ is a product of reaction $j$.\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{ij} = 0$: Chemical species (metabolite) $i$ is not connected with reaction $j$\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{ij}<0$: Chemical species (metabolite) $i$ is _consumed_ by reaction $j$. Species $i$ is a reactant of reaction $j$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we start, divide into teams and familiarize yourself with the lab. Then, execute the `Run All Cells` command to check if you (or your neighbor) have any code or setup issues. Code issues, then raise your hands - and let's get those fixed!\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Task 1: Setup, Data, Constants (20 min)__: Let's take 20 minutes to review the dataset we'll explore today and set up some values we'll use in the other tasks. We'll load the data and do some initial _data munging_ (also called [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)) to get the dataset in a form that we'll use in our analysis.\n",
    "* __Task 2: Compute the eigendecomposition (10 min)__: In this task, we'll compute the eigendecomposition of the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ matrix [using the `eigen(...)` method exported by the `LinearAlgebra.jl` package](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.eigen) and some checks on the results.\n",
    "* __Task 3: What does the largest eigenvalue/eigenvector tell us (20 min)?__: Now that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, in this task, we'll explore what the largest eigenvector coefficients tell us about the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ matrix and, by extension, the stoichiometric matrix $\\mathbf{S}$. Is there something interesting here?"
