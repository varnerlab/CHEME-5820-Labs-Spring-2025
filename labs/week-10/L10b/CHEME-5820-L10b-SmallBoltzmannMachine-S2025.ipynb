    "A [Boltzmann Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine) consists of a set of binary units (neurons, nodes, vertices, etc.) that are fully connected, with no self-connections. Formally, [a Boltzmann Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine) $\\mathcal{B}$ is an fully connected _undirected weighted graph_ defined by the tuple $\\mathcal{B} = \\left(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}, \\mathbf{W},\\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{s}\\right)$.\n",
    "* __Units__: Each unit (vertex, node, neuron) $v_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V}$ has a binary state (`on` or `off`) and a bias value \n",

    "* __Edges__: Each edge $e\\in\\mathcal{E}$ has a weight. The weight of the edge connecting $v_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V}$ and $v_{j}\\in\\mathcal{V}$, is denoted by $w_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{W}$, where the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}|\\times|\\mathcal{V}|}$ is symmetric, i.e. $w_{ij} = w_{ji}$ and $w_{ii} = 0$ (no self loops). The weights $w_{ij}\\in\\mathbb{R}$ determine the strength of the connection between the two nodes. \n",
    "* __States__: The state of each node is represented by a binary vector $\\mathbf{s}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}|}$, where $s_{i}\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ is the state of node $v_{i}$. When $s_{i} = 1$, the node is `on`, and when $s_{i} = -1$, the node is `off`. The set of all possible state _configurations_ is denoted by $\\mathcal{S} \\equiv \\left\\{\\mathbf{s}^{(1)},\\mathbf{s}^{(2)},\\ldots,\\mathbf{s}^{(N)}\\right\\}$, where $N$ is the number of possible state configurations, or $N = 2^{|\\mathcal{V}|}$ for binary units.\n",
