The [`Flux.jl` library supports _many_ optimizers](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/reference/training/optimisers/#Optimisers-Reference) which are all some version of gradient descent. We'll use [Gradient descent with momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Momentum) where the `λ` parameter denotes the `learning rate` and `β` denotes the momentum parameter. We save information about the optimizer in the `opt_state` variable, which will eventually get passed to the training method."
