    "# L14d: Understanding Self-Attention Mechanisms\n",
    "In this lab, we'll revisit the update rule of [modern Hopfield networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217) and show that it is an example of self-attention, namely the scaled dot product attention mechanism.\n",

    "* _What is self-attention?_ [Attention mechanisms and self-attention](https://slds-lmu.github.io/seminar_nlp_ss20/attention-and-self-attention-for-nlp.html) in a [transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) compute a representation of each element in an input sequence by weighing and aggregating information from all other elements in the same sequence, using _learned_ query, key, and value projections to dynamically determine the relevance of each element based on their contextual relationships.\n",
    "* _Scaled dot product attention_? Scaled dot-product attention in transformers calculates the relevance of each element in a sequence by taking the dot product of query and key vectors, scaling by the inverse square root of their dimensionality to stabilize gradients, applying softmax to obtain attention weights, and then aggregating value vectors through a weighted sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "Before we start, execute the `Run All Cells` command to check if you (or your neighbor) have any code or setup issues. Code issues, then raise your hands - and let's get those fixed!\n",
    "* __Task 1: Setup, Data, Prerequisites (10 min)__: In this task, we set up the computational environment and then specify a simple text sequence, e.g., a sentence without punctuation. From this sequence, we'll build a vocabulary, an inverse vocabulary, and the training datasets for the CBOW and skip-gram models. Finally, we'll train a Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model instance on a sample input sequence. \n",
    "* __Task 2: Does a Modern Hopfield Network use Attention (20 min)?__ In this task, we revisit the update rule of the [modern Hopfield network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217) that we implemented in week 9 using our natural language problem. We'll explore the update rule in depth and gain some intuition about how it works.\n",
