    "* __Task 2: Build the Context Models__:In this task, we will build several models of the contextual information used to inform the agent's recommendations. These models, which are [instances of the `MyBanditConsumerContextModel` type](src/Types.jl), hold various parameters that will be used in the `world(...)` function that we developed in Task 1.\n",

We will use the same bandit algorithm in all cases but vary the context model to see how it influences the agent's decisions and performance. We display the results, and ask you a few discussion questions.\n",
